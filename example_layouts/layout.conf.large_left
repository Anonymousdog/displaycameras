# This is the camera feed/windows layout configuration file for the
# displaycameras service.  It ONLY configures the layout and feeds for
# the cameras; the rest of the configuration is in displaycameras.conf.
# See the comments in that file for notes on configuring the below.

# This is a layout file intended to emulate the layout for six cameras
# in the Unifi system (with one large, mid-res feed in the upper left
# and smaller, low-res feeds arrayed around the right and bottom) on a
# 1080p monitor.

# You might use this as a layout.conf.defaultlayout file and remove
# the /etc/layout.conf.1920x1080 file if one exists (or enable display
# resolution autodetection and make this file your 1920x1080 layout config file).
# It will never match autodetected display resolution and applied automatically
# with the "large_left" file name suffix.

# Window names
