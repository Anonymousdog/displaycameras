# This is the camera feed/windows layout configuration file for the
# displaycameras service.  It ONLY configures the layout and feeds for
# the cameras; the rest of the configuration is in displaycameras.conf.
# See the comments in that file for notes on configuring the below.

# This example defines six 960x600 windows, two of which are off-screen to the right,
# through which the service rotates six camera feeds
# on a 1920x1200 monitor.  If this suites your needs, modify only the camera names to taste
# and feed URLs to what your cameras or NVR provides.
